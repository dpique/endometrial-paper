This repository hosts the code used to generate the figures and analysis in the following manuscript to appear in *BMC Cancer*:

"Identification of a novel subgroup of endometrial cancer patients with loss of thyroid hormone receptor expression and improved survival"

This manuscript uses [receptLoss](https://github.com/dpique/receptLoss), a new R package also available on [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/receptLoss.html) that is designed to capture genes that lose expression in a subset of tumors. ReceptLoss identifies several previously unreported nuclear hormone receptors whose expression is lost in endometrial cancer and that may serve as biomarkers of survival or targets for treatment.
